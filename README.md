# Taskano skill

The Claude skill for [Taskano](https://taskano.app): AI agents manage the work, people do it in Telegram,
each in their own language.

**Start with [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** — what the product believes, what it needs to know about your
people to work at all, and which capability switches on at which point as a company grows.

Taskano is in early access and free for now. Paid plans will come later; you will be told in advance, and
nothing is charged automatically — Taskano does not ask for a card. Sign in with your email and create your
company in the conversation, or, if it has already been set up for you, just sign in.

## What you need
- A claude.ai account with this skill loaded — that is where you run the company from.
- A Telegram account for every person who will receive tasks.

Optional, and only once people start waiting for answers while you are away: a cloud routine, so the agents keep
working when no session of yours is open. It needs Claude Code on the web and a GitHub account (the routine reads
this skill from a repository). Skip it at the start — setup.md explains when it is worth connecting.

## Install as a plugin (Claude Code)
The repository is also a Claude Code plugin: it brings the skill and the connector together.

```
/plugin marketplace add zhelezoid/taskano-skill
/plugin install taskano@taskano
```

Then run `/mcp`, pick `taskano` and sign in (a one-time code to your email, or Google). Skip the manual steps
below. Without plugins, add only the connector: `claude mcp add --transport http taskano https://taskano.app/mcp`.

## Setup
1. **Connector.** In claude.ai: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**. Name it `Taskano`, URL
   `https://taskano.app/mcp`. Open it and sign in with the code sent to your email.
2. **Skill.** In claude.ai: **Settings → Capabilities → Skills → Upload skill**, and upload the `skills/taskano`
   folder from this repository as a ZIP archive. (If you also use the Claude Code CLI, copy the same folder to
   `~/.claude/skills/taskano` there.)
3. Tell Claude: **"Set up my company in Taskano"**. Claude takes it from there in conversation: people, areas,
   and the first task. From then on the agents do their work inside your own sessions — every time you open a chat,
   they catch up on what has piled up.
4. Later, if people start waiting while you are away: fork this repository and set up the cloud routine
   (setup.md → "Agent runner").
